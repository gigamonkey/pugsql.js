A quick-and-dirty implementation of the idea behind Daniel McKinley’s excellent
[PugSQL] Python library for Javascript.

Unlike PugSQL, pugsql.js is not multi-database largely because I can’t find a
Javascript library equivalent to SQLAlchemy. It works with SQLite using the
[better-sqlite3] library.
